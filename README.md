## How to run my code.
There are two matlab file in the root dictionary, one is main.m and the other is BundleAdjustment.m,
the latter contains Bunldle Adjustment while the former don't.

I write the code in Matlab R2019A, and the input is three picture which are 1, 2 and 3.jpg, the calibrate parameter is stored in the camera.mat and is loaded everytime the program runs.
