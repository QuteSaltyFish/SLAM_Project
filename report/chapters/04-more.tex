\section{Summary}

 After this project, I learned a lot about the deep learning and how to determine if the model is a good module. And next I will study hard on deep learning and hope I can invent my own network structure one day.

 \section{How to Run My Code}

 The github repo is https://github.com/QuteSaltyFish/ML_project, and the evaluation code is submission.py, the model is stored on Baidu Net disk, the link is https://pan.baidu.com/s/1op-vFAqOCSbf8ggXpdq0Zg. And just change the model load dictionary and the output in the code, which is easy to find, U can get the result.
